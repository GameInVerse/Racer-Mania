A note on performance
=====================

The performance of this game is **very** machine/browser dependent. It works quite well in modern
browsers, especially those with GPU canvas acceleration, but a bad graphics driver can kill it stone
dead. So your mileage may vary. There are controls provided to change the rendering resolution
and the draw distance to scale to fit your machine.

Currently supported browsers include:

 * Firefox (v12+) works great, 60fps at high res - Nice!
 * Chrome (v19+) works great, 60fps at high res... provided you dont have a bad GPU driver
 * IE9 - ok, 30fps at medium res... not great, but at least it works

The current state of mobile browser performance is pretty dismal. Dont expect this to be playable on
any mobile device.
